# PyBer_Analysis

##Overview of the analysis:

This analysis summarises the ride-sharing data categorised by city and type and to visualise this information for better understanding of the available data. For the purpose of the analysis we use the merged data from two csv files - city_data.csv & ride_data.csv and create dataframes based on city types - Rural, Suburban and Urban.

This Analysis summarises the ride-sharing data by city and type in a dataframe. This dataframe is further used to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

##Results:

The analysed data is summarized on the basis of city type - Rural, Suburban & Urban. Against each of these city types the values for total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver are listed in a dataframe. A screenshot of this dataframe is enclosed below. In this screenshot it can be seen that total rides are highest for urban cities and lowest for rural cities with suburban cities in between. Similar figures are seen for the total drivers & total fares. However, this trend changes when we see the average fare per ride and per driver for different city types. For rural cities the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is the highest followed by suburban cities and least for urban cities.


##Summary:

Rural areas have the least driver count despite having the highest average fares. To increase revenues from these cities it might be beneficial to add more drivers. Similar approach can be used on suburban areas as well.

Rural areas have the least ride counts. To increase revenues it might be beneficial to focus on increasing these figures.

Urban areas have the least average fares despite having the highest driver count. To increase revenues from these cities it might be beneficial to increase the average fares.
